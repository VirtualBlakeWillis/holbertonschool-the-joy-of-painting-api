# Joy of Painting API Project Readme

Welcome to the Joy of Painting API project! In this project, we will build a backend from scratch to create an API that allows users to filter episodes of "The Joy of Painting" based on various criteria. The project involves the following main tasks:

## 1. Design a Database

In this task, we will review the provided datasets and design a database using UML documentation that will store all the necessary information for the API. The data has been collected from various sources and is currently spread across multiple files and formats. The goal is to create a centralized database that will make the data usable through the API.

## 2. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

Once the database is designed, the next step is to import the data from the different sources into the database. Since the data may not perfectly align with the database structure, we will need to write custom scripts in any language of our choice to extract the data, transform it if necessary, and then load it into the database. Properly matching and handling inconsistencies in the data will be crucial to ensure accurate filtering through the API.

## 3. Build the API

The final task is to build the API that will utilize the data in the database. The API will handle filtering based on user-provided criteria, such as the month of original broadcast, subject matter, and color palette. Users should be able to apply multiple filters simultaneously and specify whether the filters should match all selected criteria or include any matching criteria. The API will communicate with the database to retrieve and return JSON data containing the relevant episode information.



## Running the Project

Please follow the instructions in each repository's README to run the project locally. Make sure to set up the database, perform the ETL process to import the data, and then launch the API to provide filtering functionality.
